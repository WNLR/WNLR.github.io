            <h3 class="featurette-heading">Best Overall Female - Evelin Meza, Greenfield High School</h3>
<p>For every distance over 800 meters, Evelin is this year&rsquo;s outstanding female athlete. Her league- and school- record-setting track and cross country times, as well as her academic performance (3.94 GPA), superb traits as a role model, and commitment to her team&rsquo;s success are nothing short of brilliant, and these combined qualities make her a stellar all-around candidate for this scholarship. As one of the top runners in the entire Central Coast Cross Country Section (CCS), we are proud to recognize Evelin for all of her accomplishments. In addition to exceptional academic and athletic success, Evelin is also a member of Greenfield High Schools Physics Club, Book Club, College Club, and Volleyball Team. Evelin will use her WNLR scholarship to assist with her academic and athletic pursuits at San Jose State in Fall of 2017.</p>
