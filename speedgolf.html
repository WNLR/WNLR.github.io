<h1>Speed Golf</h1>
<p>Monday September 10, 8 am - Noon<br />MPC Track</p>
<p><a href="http://extreme-impact.com/extreme-impact-events/">An Extreme Impact, Inc - Event</a><br />Hosted by <br />Don &amp; Christina Romeka&nbsp;</p>
<p>$50 includes 9 holes of speed golf, lunch, and awards - Proceeds to benefit the <a href="http://www.wnlr.org/scholarships">Wednesday Night Laundry Runners Scholarship Fund</a></p>
<p>Come join us for a fun morning of golf + running/fast walking and help raise money for the WNLR Scholarship Fund! 9 holes of the fastest golf you&rsquo;ll ever play!</p>
<p>We are deeply honored this year to have the legendary Steve Scott joining us as one our participants. Among his many awesome accomplishments, Steve held the American record (3:47.69) in the mile for over 26 year and holds the world record for the number of times of breaking the 4 minutes barrier in the mile (136). Most importantly, of course, Steve is regarded as the founder of Speed Golf! In 1979 Steve played a regulation 18 hole course in under 30 minutes while shooting a respectable 95.</p>
<h2>What is speed golf?</h2>
<p>Here are the basics:<br />- Your score is your golf score + your time elapsed between your first shot and your final putt on hole 9.<br />- Players will tee off singly about 3 minutes apart. If you pass someone, just yell &ldquo;Fore&rdquo; and hit away. We will attempt to seed people to minimize passing but still may happen!<br />- No carts. This is a running/fast walking event. You may carry a maximum of 6 clubs + putter. No limit on how many balls you carry :-)<br />- You don&rsquo;t have to rake sand traps or pull pins. This is speed golf!<br />- You can choose whether to play the &ldquo;white&rdquo; tees (normally the men&rsquo;s tees), &ldquo;green&rdquo; tees (for men 70+), or the &ldquo;red&rdquo; tees (normally the women&rsquo;s tees).</p>
<h2>How do I sign up?</h2>
<p>Space for golfers is limited! Sign up by sending your name, email, choice of tees, golf handicap (if you have one), and your approximate 5K running time, to beverlyzalan@gmail.com</p>
